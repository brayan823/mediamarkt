# Brayan Antequero Challenge

#### Requeriments

You need to have mongodb installed, to run the backend, I decide to incorporate a database to make the challenge as complete and structured as possible

In both projects, it's only necessary to execute

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

# Important topics

- The application was developed using typescript and a non-relational MongoDB database and mongoose.
- Jest was used for the unit tests.
- For communication between frontend and backend was used Apollo server / client
